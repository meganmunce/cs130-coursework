      <h3>Desi-American women fight period stigma during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month</h3>
      <p>Meghna Gaddam, Samanvi Kanugula and Mahie Gopalka are the three Desi-American women behind PERIOD at Northwestern fighting for an end to period stigma in their culture and the state of Illinois.</p>
      <p>The social-media based student organization started after Gaddam, the organization’s founder and president, attended a Policy Bootcamp with PERIOD, a national nonprofit that spreads education and menstrual product donations to stop period poverty and stigma.</p>

      <h3>Supreme Court decision disrupts students’ voting plan</h3>
      <p>The Supreme Court of the United States reversed a lower court’s ruling allowing Wisconsin to extend the deadline for absentee ballots to be counted on Tuesday, forcing many of the state’s residents to choose between voting and potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
      <p>The 5-4 ruling overturned an executive order by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers extending the deadline for absentee voting to June 9 and potentially threw out as many as half a million mail-in ballots that had not been postmarked by April 7. The 10 other states with April primaries chose to delay primaries or shift to by-mail only voting due to the outbreak of the virus.</p>
