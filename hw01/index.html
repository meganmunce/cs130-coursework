          <p>Hi! My name is Megan Munce. I'm a sophomore at Northwestern University, where I'm pursuing a double major in journalism and political science with an anticipated graduation date of June 2022. Outside of academics, I also write for The Daily Northwestern, compete on Northwestern Mock Trial, serve as a Peer Advisor for incoming students and am a member of Delta Gamma women's fraternity!</p>

            <h3>Supreme Court decision disrupts students' voting plans</h3>
            <h4>The Daily Northwestern</h4>
            <img src="https://dailynorthwestern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/US-NEWS-CORONAVIRUS-LIVE-UPDATES-STIMULUS-CHECKS-AU-900x695.jpg" alt="Wisconsin voters wait in long poll lines to vote amid the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States." class="center">
            <p>The Supreme Court of the United States reversed a lower court’s ruling allowing Wisconsin to extend the deadline for absentee ballots to be counted on Tuesday, forcing many of the state’s residents to choose between voting and potential exposure to COVID-19. The 5-4 ruling overturned an executive order by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers extending the deadline for absentee voting to June 9 and potentially threw out as many as half a million mail-in ballots that had not been postmarked by April 7. The 10 other states with April primaries chose to delay primaries or shift to by-mail only voting due to the outbreak of the virus.

            <h3>Northwestern joins action collaborative to address sexual and gender harassment in higher education</h3>

              <p>Weinberg sophomore Chloe Krugel, a neuroscience major and psychology minor, says she often feels like her male peers and professors have discounted her work due to her gender. Krugel said the climate of academia can be hostile for women. Northwestern recently announced its commitment to address that problem, as well as other forms of gender-based discrimination, by joining the Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education as a founding member.</p>

              <p>Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said she decided to write her memoir after noticing that other books about the black experience focused on individuals rather than the wider narrative.“This is a story of collective surviving,” Cullors said.</p>
