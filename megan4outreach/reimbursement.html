  <h2>Q: How would you use the website to digitize the reimbursement and tournament form process?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would create an online form for reimbursements and upload all tournament forms.</h2>
  <p>First, I'd work with the Treasurer to create an online reimbursement form and link it on the website for members to have constant access to. Instead of having to make sure you keep all your receipts during tournaments and turn the min on time, members could take a photo of the receipt, fill out the required details, and hit submit. As a person who has lost out on lots of reimbursement mmoney because I've forgotten to keep receipts or forgotten to turn them in on time, I know this would be really helpful in making sure members aren't paying out of pocket.</p>
  <p>Second, I'd also upload all required tournament forms from the Treasurer and Logistics Chair on to the website so members could have constant access to them, rather than having to save a copy they get in practice or dig through their email to find when it was emailed to them. For this, I'd also create a form on the website so after downloading forms, members could submit them online via the form so the Treasurer and Logistics Chair can easily collect them and keep them in one place.</p>
