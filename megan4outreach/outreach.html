  <h2> My General Platform </h2>
  <p>Hey NUMT! It's Megan, and as you already know if you've gotten this far, I'm running for NUMT Outreach Chair for next year. This year, I had a great time both representing and serving you as a member of exec, but also getting to play around with our social media presence by posting birthday stories on Instagram, using social media to promote our fundraisers, and creating the member spotlights that have been going up recently. </p>
  <p>Next year, I want to continue improving our digital presence and not only make it a way for us to show off to our friends, family, and other programs, but also something that can My platform can be best separated into two goals:</p>
  <h3>1. Showcasing Members</h3>
  <p>I want to continue to make cool and creative posts that show off our amazing members, like the animated spotlights! Aside from just posting about members, I want to make sure our content is engaging. For example, I'd bring back Buzzfeed quizzes about each team that people could take for fun, or make more Instagram story challenges like the Bingo board.</p>
    <p>I also want to keep a running list of the year’s team and individual achievements on our website to keep track of our amazing success and give families and friends a place to keep up with NUMT.</p>
<p>I'd run specific campaigns over social media during three of the most importnat times in our program: recruitment, fundraisers, and the tournament(s) we hold. During recruitment, I'd promote our information sessions over social media, as well as daily reasons to join our team (because there are just so many). During fundraisers, I'd create graphics for our accounts and each member to post on their social media to promote our fundraisers, like I did this year with the bake sale. Finally, during tournaments I'd use Twitter to push out pairings and all-loss to make it easier on our tournament directors during that busy weekend.</p>
    <h3>2. Serving Members</h3>
    <p>I also want to use the website to make things easier on members and the rest of exec. I'd create a password-locked page on the website for members to have constant access to team resources. One major resource would be creating an all-program calendar so teams can facilitate joint practices or scrimmages to promote collaboration between teams. Another resource would be an anonymous feedback form so members have a way to directly tell exec about potential problems, and an anonymous incident reporting form; both of which I describe in greater detail in the green "Specific Policy Ideas" section.</p>
      <p>I would also work with the Treasurer and Logistics Chair to move the reimbursement process and required tournament forms online through the website to ease the burden on members.</p>
  <p>Overall, a common theme I'll hope you notice in my platform is that all of these policies -- and the reason I want to run for exec at all -- all comes back to one idea: I wouldn't be the person I am without the people on this team, and they deserve to be listened to and celebrated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading! If you'd like to see some of these plans broken down in greater detail, or take a look at some policies that aren't directly related to Outreach Chair but that I am passionate about implementing with the rest of exec, check out the green section titled "Specific Policy Ideas" and, as always, feel free to reach out to me personally with any questions or suggestions!</p>
