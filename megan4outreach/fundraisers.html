  <h2>Q: How would you organize educational workshops?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would ask members to lead workshops in their given skill area and record those workshops for further use.</h2>
  <p>Last year when I ran for exec, the idea I was most passionate about was extending bootcamp to last over a week instead of all in one day. Once on exec, I learned that this is basically impossible because of how late we start in the year and how quickly we need to get teams tournament-ready.</p>
  <p>However, when we rush through bootcamp and leave the rest of education to fall captains, members lose out on the opportunity to learn from all the people they aren't on a fall team with. For example, this year, it was difficult for Austin and me to teach members of Team TBDyrell how to close when neither of us had experience with closing.</p>
  <p>To change this, I'd organize optional educational workshops built around different skills: expert witnessing, objection battles, opening statements, party representative witnessing, etc.! I'd ask people who are especially skilled in those areas -- like Ruby with closing, or Olivia for character witnessing -- to lead these workshops teaching members tips and tricks, as well as workshopping their own skills and performances. These workshops would be optional but available to anyone who wants to get better at any particular skill. This means that even if you aren't assigned to a certain role, you can still learn about that role. For example, if you're just a witness in fall, but really want to learn to be an attorney, you could attend attorneying workshops to do so!</p>
  <p>Importantly, I'd also record these workshops and upload them to the Google Drive to contribute educational resources to the future and give access to any members who might not have been able to attend that particular workshop.</p>
  <p>Along with uploading these new videos, I'd also clean up the existing footage we have in our Google Drive to clearly label good examples of pretrial ettiquette or defendant crosses so people don't have to dig through a mountain of footage to be able to find the best examples to learn from.</p>
