  <h2>Q: How would you utilize social media for recruitment and fundraisers?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would ask members to lead workshops in their given skill area and record those workshops for further use.</h2>
  <p>This year, as Fundraising Chair, I designed graphics for our different fundraisers ad emailed all program members to coordinate pub pushes on social media to promote the Facebook event for our fundraiser and provide information about the fundraiser itself. (Check out the "My Qualifications" section on the home page to see these graphics!) I'd work with the Fundraising Chair next year to do the same to promote our fundraisers for next year, as well as using social media directly for fundraising, such as creating donation bingo boards for Instagram stories!</p>
  <p>During recruitment season (Wildcat Welcome through the last day of info sessions), I'd post daily content on our Instagram story and ask members to share it to reach a wider audience. I'd post Q&A stories for potential new members to ask questions, do member takeovers so people could see how cool the people on this team are, recap our amazing results from this year and publicize our info session dates. This would be especially crucial in the event of a remote fall quarter where we can't rely on our usual flyers around campus and banner by the Arch to attract potential new members. Because I plan to be on campus during Wildcat Welcome (check out my section describing steps I'll take to be on exec while remote if you haven't already!) I could post content from campus and feature members of the team in person.</p>
