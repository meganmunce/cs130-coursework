  <h2>Q: How would you make necessary adjustments to prepare for the impact of COVID-19?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would facilitate online tryouts to start off educating as many new members as we can, organize remote education, and prepare to have to hold a second round of recruitment when we return to campus.</h2>
<p>Though I'm hoping my hardest that we'll be on campus this fall, it would be amiss to not prepare for the outcome that we won't be. The biggest adjustment I think being remote for fall quarter would cause is to our current recruitment. Here's how I would adapt:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Facilitate online tryouts.</b> I'd start by holding online information sessions -- as well as recording and uploading an information session for people who couldn't make it to one -- and aggressively promoting those info sessions on social media. I'd then hold tryouts over Zoom by asking potential new members to send in a video of their opening statement, along with a synchronous Zoom call with exec members to get questioned as a witness and to ask personality questions. Of course, this means we wouldn't be able to reach all the tryouts we usually pull in by posting flyers everywhere and advertising at the student org fair, but I'm confident we could still pull in a good amount of tryouts to select from, but perhaps would just take fewer new members.</li>
    <li><b>Start educating early.</b> If we lose fall season to allow new members to try different things and learn, it'll be even more important to educate our new members remotely. I'd have weekly Zoom calls to educate them on different basic skills and trial procedure, and I'd also still assign them on to fall teams so they could have a group of people to bond with and work with. I'd also rely on lots of old footage we have to educate new members on what real trials look like and good examples of mock trial in action.</li>
    <li><b>Hold a second round of recruitment once we return to campus.</b> Because our first round of recruitment will likely be much smaller than usual, and because it would be inaccessible to people without strong or any internet connection at their homes, I would plan to hold a second round of recruitment once we return back to campus. These members would likely go through a more traditional bootcamp type education because they would be starting later, but we could still start onboarding them by assigning them to different teams to learn from. While this round of new members may or may not have the opportunity to compete, based on how quickly invitationals and AMTA tournaments get started back up again, we could at least get a head start on educating them and preparing them to compete for next year.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, the most important adjustment will be continuous flexibility according to Northwestern announcements, federal and state government orders, and what AMTA chooses to do. It'll be a learning experience for everyone, but I'm confident in our abilites to adapt and succeed.</p>
