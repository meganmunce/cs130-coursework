  <h2>Q: How would you improve equitable access to coaching?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would incorporate coaching on to the full-program calendar and make coaches report hours spent with each team.</h2>
  <p>I know firsthand that access to coaches on this team can be very uneven depending on age and which team you're on, so when I talked to members who found the same problem happening, I wanted to make a system that would guarantee that every competitive team has equal access to coaching.</p>
  <p>First, I would incorporate coach availability on to the full-program calendar. This would allow members to know when coaches are free and available to work with. For example, if you see on the calendar that Joe is coming to campus on Thursday from 6-8pm to work with Team TBDyrell, you could ask to work with him right before or right after that practice. Or if Kate has a free 2 hours on Friday where she can Facetime people and work with them, she could schedule that on the calendar for people to see and take advantage of.</p>
  <p>Along with recording when they're free, I would ask coaches to record the amount of hours they spend working with each team. This would force coaches to be accountable and would allow us to monitor whether any team is receiving less attention than another.</p>
  <p>Finally, of course, I would keep in constant contact with fall and winter captains to make sure they feel like their team is receiving adequate coaching. Rather than waiting until now, at the end of the year, to find out that some Charmander and Squirtle team members felt like they weren't being coached as much, I would be more active about reaching out and making sure they're getting equitable access to this program's coaching resources.</p>
