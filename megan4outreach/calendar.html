  <h2>Q: How would you coordinate a full-program calendar?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I'd link a calendar on our website and give access to fall and winter captains to input practices.</h2>
  <p>We all benefit when teams collaborate with each other, from scrimmaging before big tournaments to coming to each other's practices to offer a fresh eye for directs and crosses.</p>
  <p>While we do have a team calendar right now, it's just a Google Spreadsheet -- which you can't import to add to your own calendar -- and it's rarely updated. I'd create a shared Google Calendar that we'd keep linked in the website and I'd give access to all fall and winter captains, as well as exec.</p>
  <p>Sharing the calendar with fall and winter team captains would allow them to list all of their practice locations and times so they could better collaborate if they want to have joint practices, or if one individual member wants to drop in to observe another team's practice or get help. For example, as a freshman, I used to come to A team practices all the time so Kate, who crossed experts, could cross me as an expert so we could both get practice.
    It would have been much easier for me if I could look up when and where A team was, and then text Kate to ask if I could come and get crossed at a time where I was free and she was already practicing.</p>
    <p>It would also let older members of the team see when other teams are having practices so they could drop by and help out. The energy and effort Team Pikachu and Team Bulbasaur put into helping Team Charmander and Team Squirtle before the Evanston Regionals was a great example of this team working together to achieve our best, but unfortunately, was an isolated example. If older members have access to other teams's practice schedules, they could drop in to provide that support throughout the season, rather than just right before Regionals, and conversely team captains can see whether more experienced teams are having practice at certain times, and, if they aren't, ask members of that team to attend their practice instead to help out.</p>
  <p>Exec would also be able to use the calendar to update it with tournament dates as we figure out what tournaments people will be going to, full-program meetings, social events and fundraisers.</p>
