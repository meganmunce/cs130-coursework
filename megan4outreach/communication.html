  <h2>Q: How would you facilitate communication between exec and the program?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would put an anonymous feedback form on the website and also hold quarterly town halls for members to reflect on the past quarter and what we could change to make this program better for the future!</h2>
<p>Having spent one year on exec and one year not, I realized now how most of the program is unaware of the totality of what exec is doing all the time. I want to increase exec transparency and loop program members into decisions more often so that members have direct access to creating change, whether or not they're on exec.</p>
<p>First, I'd create an anonymous feedback form that would be open year-round and linked on the website so members have easy access to it. As Outreach Chair, I'd monitor this form regularly to watch for comments coming in. This would be a constantly accessible way for members to give direct feedback to exec or introduce problems exec might not be aware of.</p>
<p>Second, I'd hold quarterly town halls where members can discuss the year and propose things that went well and things that went poorly. I'd aim to have full-program meeting more regularly, but I think holding a town hall in particular every quarter would encourage members to actively think about how to make the program better throughout the year, rather than just at the end when writing platforms to run for exec. </p>
<p>I'd also work to loop in members more into exec decisions when possible. For example, this year's exec only had members of A and B on it, which isn't an unlikely phenomenon because to be on exec, you have to be at least a sophomore and involved enough in the program to want to hold a leadership role. I'd loop in newer members or members of other teams more often into decisions that affect them to hear a diversity of opinions and make sure there aren't any unforeseen consequences to certain exec decisions. </p>
<p>Overall, I'd work to be an approachable member of exec for people to be able to bring these problems to year-round. Even when I'm away for fall quarter, I plan to be a participating member of a fall team and to hold Zoom office hours to get to know the new members, even if I won't be there in person to see them. And I'm also planning on visiting home every once in a while because it's simply impossible to go 9 months without an NUMT party! I want to make every effort to give members of this program to have their voice heard not only through electing members of exec to represent them, but also through direct feedback.</p>
