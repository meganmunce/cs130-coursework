  <h2>Q: How would you improve stack education?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would ask the coaches to do individual check ins with each member prior to emailing out the results of stack to the full program.</h2>
  <p>Our team made huge strides in improving stack transparency by having coaches announce when captains had been selected and when each team had been created, but unfortunately, competitive stack is still an extremely stressful time for everyone that often leaves many members feeling confused or disappointed.</p>
  <p>A lot of that is inherent to being in a competitive activity and the fact that there are limited spots on each team, however, I still think there are ways we can lessen the negative feelings.</p>
  <p>I'd ask the coaches to split up the members on the team and make sure that they do an individual check in with each member prior to announcing the results of stack to the entire program. That way they could tell each member the results of stack personally, instead of forcing them to find out at the same time that everyone else does in a mass email. It would also allow the coaches to give some insight into why that member was stacked in a particular way and to answer any questions a member might have about their role or the stack process. Overall, I think this would lessen the impact on people who might feel disappointed about their stack results and re-emphasize the point of stack, which is to create the best teams that we possibly can and to give every member a role they can do well in.</p>
