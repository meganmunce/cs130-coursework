  <h2>Q: How would you function as a remote member of exec for fall quarter?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: Using this year as a model, I would utilize Zoom to not only constantly communicate with exec, but also all other members!</h2>
<p>This fall quarter (if it happens), I'll be in DC on Medill on the Hill! However, I've already thought a lot about the ways I'd continue to be an active member of exec and of this program, even while I'm abroad.</p>
<p>From being on an exec this year that had two members abroad for the fall, I know that communication is the most important part of being on exec while abroad. I would plan lots of Zoom calls to keep up with exec's progress and decision making. I also plan to be in Evanston over the summer and during Wildcat Welcome, so I could still meet with exec in person at least once and help out with recruitment!</p>
<p>Moreover, Outreach Chair is a position uniquely suited to being remote, since you can post on the website and on socila media from anywhere! I'd crowdsource photos from the team by setting up and maintaining a Google Drive folder with team photos to be posted, and I'd also keep in constant contact with fall captains to get photos from them and share the Instagram password with them so they could make cute posts on the story  while they're at tournaments.</p>
<p>Finally, because I knew this was going to be an issue if I went on Medill on the Hill, I've already spoken to my journalism advisors and made sure that I'll have time to devote to mock trial while I'm in DC. I won't have any work or class during weekends, or on Fridays, so I'll be free to spend time accomplishing all the goals I've set out for this position and for exec! I'll make sure to watch all tryout videos and give my feedback to exec, I'll be assigned to a fall team to help out and I'll host virtual Zoom friend dates to get to know our new members!</p>
