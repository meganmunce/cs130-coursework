  <h2>Q: How would you better define the role of shadows?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would be clear about the expectations of the program and add tweaks to prioritize education.</h2>
  <p>Now that we've had the role for a year now, it's time to give better definition to what it means to be on the shadow program. I'd be very clear about that, from putting it in the info sessions to confirming with each individual shadow what their role would be before asking whether they'd like to accept the role.
  First, I'd make sure we communicate to each shadow that they won't immediately be on the program, but have the potential to be put on a team if we have other people drop out or if they show lots of improvement after some more practice and learning.
  Second, I'd have exec work with captains to come up with practice schedules and be clear with shadows that they aren't expected to commit the same amount of time as a regular member, but, of course, can if they want to. For example, if there are two practices a week, allowing a shadow to only come to one.
  Third, I'd have exec hold monthly check-in meetings with all of the shadows to get more feedback on the program and to ensure shadows know they are a valued part of the team.</p>
  <p>I'd also make changes that prioritize education. After all, the reason we accept someone on to the shadow program is because we think they have potential, but need to work on some basic skills first.
  I'd talk to shadows at the beginning of the season about what skills or roles they want to work on, and I'd make sure they get time to work with some of the best members of our program, regardless of whether they're on a fall team with them.
  For example, if one shadow is especially interested at getting better at giving closings, I'd make sure they were able to attend a practice with Ruby and get to work on closing. Or if we gauge during tryouts that a shadow has the potential to be a really good character witness, but isn't quite there yet, I'd have them attend a practice where they could work with Jacob on character witnessing.</p>
<p>Of course, in an ideal world, we'd be able to just take as many new members as we want. However, with a huge amount of returning members next year, and with potential budget cuts due to the financial crisis caused by COVID-19, that might not be realistic. I think the shadow program was a huge step in us letting less people fall through the cracks -- after all, several of our shadows ended up becoming competing members and huge assets to this team.</p>
  <p>Overall, while shadows are equally important to this team than every other new member, we should also acknowledge that they shouldn't have to put in the same amount of work as a new member if they aren't getting the same benefit out. We should make changes that allow shadows more leeway in not having to spend as much time on mock trial if they don't want to, and also prioritizing giving them access to the education to make them into competing members during the winter season or following fall.</p>
