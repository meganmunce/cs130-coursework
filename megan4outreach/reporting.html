  <h2>Q: How would you establish anonymous incident reporting?</h2>
</div>
<div class="general">
  <h2>A: I would create a procedure for anonymous incident reporting and a formal procedure for exec to handle such incidents.</h2>
  <p><b>CONTENT WARNING: reference to sexual assault and racial discrimination</b>
  <p>First, I'd like to thank Ruby and Steph for bouncing ideas back and forth on this with me. I'd also like to stress that <b>there was no specific incident on this team that caused me to write this part of my platform.</b> I'm a big believer in hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, and this idea was borne out of the desire that if there was ever a situation where someone had to deal with this issue, that there was a formal procedure they could make use of and that they would have resources at their disposal and, hopefully, would feel less powerless and less alone.</p>
  <p>The goal of this policy idea is to create a formal anonymous reporting resource and to set clear standards for how exec would deal with a potential sexual assault or racial discrimination incident in a survivor centric manner.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Establish a means to anonymous reporting.</b> I'd create an anoymous form accessible to members through our website where they could anonymously or unanonymously report an instance of sexual assault, sexual harassment, racial discrimination, or other instances in which they feel like another member is violating the Constitutional requirement that states: "A member of Northwestern University Mock Trial is responsible for maintaining a friendly and productive atmosphere for her team and the organization."</li>
    <li><b>Ensure confidentiality.</b> I'd also ensure that it was clear to all members that in the event that they utilize this resource, all members of exec are sworn to absolute confidentiality. This would exist for all reports of this nature, regardless of whether it came through this form, or from a program member approaching a member of exec individually to present this concern. Above all, the privacy of the reporter should be prioritizes; the only people who should know the identity of the reporter or the contents of their report are people the reporter directly authorizes to know.</li>
    <li><b>Pursue survivor centric solutions.</b> Rather than place a singular, required plan for moving forward from the report, I would prioritize the survivor's wishes and how they would like exec to procede. For example, if someone anonymously reports instances of discriminatory behavior and asks exec to have a talk with a particular member, exec should follow that plan of action. If someone anonymously reports having observed one member giving unwanted attention to another, exec could more closely watch the dynamic between those two members and make sure to step in if necessary. Alternatively, exec could discuss accomodations with coaches such as making sure two members are always on separate teams or aren't in a situation where they'd have to practice directly with one another. It's important to note that while exec does have the power to expell members, it must be done by a vote of 6 of the 7 members. That means that expulsion from the program is also an option in serious cases where the survivor requests it and the vast majority of exec sees that as the only solution. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Above all, the priority for this policy -- whether it would be adopted via an amendment to our constitution, or simply from being passed down through exec boards -- is that in the chance that anyone ever found themself to be in this position that they'd have resources available. Like many of us know, it's the people that make this program, and each member deserves exec's confidentiality and protection against potential incidents that wouldn't allow them to enjoy this program as much as they should be.
